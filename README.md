## Getting Started

API endpoints: checking out `swagger.json` file in `doc/swagger/v1` with [swagger-editor](https://editor-next.swagger.io/) to explore more about api routes.

- HTTP: [http://localhost:8000/api/v1](http://localhost:8000/api/v1)
- HTTPS: [https://localhost:8443/api/v1](https://localhost:8443/api/v1)

### Running

1. Create env file `.env` using `.env.template` as a template.
2. Set env values accordingly:
   1. TLS is enabled when `TLS_CERT_FILE` and `TLS_KEY_FILE` is set.
   2. For database, you can use the settings from `docker-compose.yml` if you want to use `db` service.
3. Set `docker-compose.yml`:
   1. Update `env_file` in `app` service to point to the env file you just created. (`.env`)
   2. Update `ports` in `app` service to reflect the ports in env file.
   3. If TLS is enabled, update `app` volumes to bind to your certificate folder location.
   4. Set path to cert files (must be the same path as in `.env`)
4. If you change app ports from anything other than `8000` and `8443`.
5. Start by running `make start` and stop by running `make stop`.

### Testing

```bash
# e2e
# Set --ssl-client-cert in test/e2e/run-api-tests.sh first
make start
make e2etest
make stop
```
